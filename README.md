System admin scripts and utility classes
========================================

Systematic is a collection of OS level and programming tools for python,
mainly just packing stuff I use all the time to one place.

Supported operating systems
---------------------------

Myself I use this module regularly on:

* Linux (debian, ubuntu, fedora, centos/redhat)
* FreeBSD 11
* MacOS

Windows support would not really even make sense, because this module is
written for unix CLI tools. It may work in windows 10 ubuntu environment
but will not be tested because I have no windows computers.

Please browse the sources for more information.
