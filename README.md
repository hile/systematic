# System admin scripts and classes #

Systematic is a collection of OS level and programming tools for python,
mainly just packing stuff I use all the time to one place. This module 
does not work on windows and is not intended to do so.

Please browse the sources for more information.

## Filesystem handling ##

Please note that filesystem mountpoint / usage parsing is implemented by
following OS dependent modules:

OS/X: darwinist
Linux: penquinst
BSDs: ultimatum
